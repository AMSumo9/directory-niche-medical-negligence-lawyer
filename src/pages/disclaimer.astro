        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Legal claims are subject to strict time limitations, known as limitation
            periods or statutes of limitations. These time limits vary by jurisdiction and type of claim.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            If you believe you may have a medical negligence claim, it is crucial that you consult with a qualified
            lawyer as soon as possible to ensure you do not miss any applicable deadlines. Failure to file a claim
            within the applicable limitation period may result in the permanent loss of your right to seek compensation.
